Description:
 pyitunesweb is an open source (GPL v3, see LICENSE file) project for being able
 to stream your iTunes library from over the web. It is made up of the following
 components:
 
    - iTunes Library XML parser (forked from http://github.com/liamks/pyitunes)
    - CGI python web interface
    - Quicktime media player

NOTE:
 This project is VERY young and will change over the next few weeks, please watch 
 this project, but download at your own risk! I am unable to give support for this
 project until it is in a more stable state.

 Also, you should always have a back-up of your iTunes library!!!! I cannot take
 any responsibility for damage or loss of your library. My opinion is backup 
 anything you don't want to loose.
 

Installation:
 $ cd webui
 $ cp settings.py.sample settings.py
 Edit settings.py and alter the values at the top of the file to match your environment
 Now setup a web site or virtual directory in apache to point to this folder 
   our .htaccess file will do most of the work for you
 $ apachectl graceful
 View the index.cgi file from a web browser
